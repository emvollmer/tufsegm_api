# tufsegm_api

[![Build Status](https://jenkins.indigo-datacloud.eu/buildStatus/icon?job=Pipeline-as-code/DEEP-OC-org/tufsegm_api/test)](https://jenkins.indigo-datacloud.eu/job/Pipeline-as-code/job/DEEP-OC-org/job/tufsegm_api/job/test)

Deepaas API for thermal urban feature segmentation (TUFSeg). This code makes use of the [TUFSeg model repo](https://github.com/emvollmer/TUFSeg).

To facilitate setting up, the bash script `setting_up_deployment.sh` can be run to install everything automatically:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emvollmer/tufsegm_api/master/setting_up_deployment.sh
source setting_up_deployment.sh
```

This takes care of all required installations and finishes by running [deepaas](https://github.com/indigo-dc/DEEPaaS).

The associated Docker container for this module can be found in https://github.com/emvollmer/DEEP-OC-tufsegm_api.

## Model Integration with DEEPaaS

The folder `tufsegm_api` is designed to contain code with which to accesss the model code
from the submodule [TUFSeg](https://github.com/emvollmer/TUFSeg).
The folder `tufsegm_api` contains an `__init__.py` file conserving the already defined methods.

Methods in `tufsegm_api` are used by the subpackage `api` to define the API interface.
See the project structure section for more information about the `api` folder.
API and CLI arguments and responses are adapted in `api.schemas` and `api.responses`.

## Testing

Testing process is automated by tox library. 
Tests are implemented following [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) framework.
Fixtures and parametrization are placed inside `conftest.py` files while
assertion tests are located on `test_*.py` files.

    - tests/data: Contains testing data (sample images).
    - tests/models: Contains a dummy model.
    - tests/test_metadata: Tests for get_metadata functionality.
    - tests/test_predictions: Tests for inference functionality.
    - tests/test_training: Tests for training functionality.

The dummy model is of the smallest possible size, but still comparatively
large. For this reason, the tests take a bit of time to run.

Running the tests with tox:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
$ tox
```

Running the tests with pytest:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements-test.txt
$ python -m pytest --numprocesses=auto --dist=loadscope tests
```
or for more detailled information
```bash
$ python -m pytest tests
```
