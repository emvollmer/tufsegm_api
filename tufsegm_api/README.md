# Accessing the [TUFSeg](https://github.com/emvollmer/TUFSeg) code

The following scripts help utilise the TUFSeg code:

- `config.py`: defines model-related CONSTANTS across the AI-project.
- `__init__.py`: contains the main functions `get_metadata`, `train`
  and `predict` called upon by the api
- `utils.py`: helper functions to run those in `__init__.py`
